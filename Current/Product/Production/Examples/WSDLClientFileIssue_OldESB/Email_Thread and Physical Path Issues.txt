Subject: Thread and Physical Path Issues

Sean,

I have created the samples that illustrate two major issues we are having…  

1:  Issue with hardcoded physical path to WSDL that is defined at compile time.  (I talked with you 
about this one before)
2:  Issue with calling a web service inside of an EJB where the EJB is deployed in OpenESB as a 
composite App – the way we have to do this is to wrap it in a thread.

I have placed a zip file on our FTP server for you to retrieve that illustrate this.  The Zip file contains a 
readme that describes each project and the tests.  Let me know if you have any questions…  

One note:  The threading issue (Item 2) – does not seem to be consistent.  Two machines do not show 
this problem, but the rest do.  We had this reported by the DoD team and then we ran into it on 
exactly the same day and have seen this issue in several projects now.

The ftp site is:  
ftp://ftp.agilex.com/outgoing/healthcare/NHINConnect/SampleForSun/WSDLClientFileIssue/

The name of the file is:  WSDLClientFileIssue.zip.

The user Name for you to use is: FTPout

With the password of: 0nlyRcv!a      (Note that this is a zero and not an o 
and it is case sensitive)

Les
